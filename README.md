# Auth

An authentication service, ready to go. The purpose of this project is to provide a customizable service,
which anyone could deploy and easily control. Plus, you could scale it however you want, and use your own database.

### Usage currently (ONLY DEV PURPOSES, not secure)

for now, since the service is not secure enough, take the source code, build the service and run it on any machine.
either view the endpoints, or if you're on react, download the "auth-ts-sdk" npm package and use it to integrate the auth service.

client side SDK free for react users on npm, using `npm i auth-ts-sdk`

### TODO:
- [ ] Create logging mechanism
- [ ] Create caching
- [ ] Build server-side SDK
- [ ] Docker deployment instructions & K8s support
- [ ] Test on AWS
